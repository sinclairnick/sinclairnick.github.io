                After graduating from high school in Auckland, New Zealand I moved away from home to pursue a science degree double majoring
                in Psychology and Physics, initially. Despite having a strong interest in physics and mathematics, and studying
                them at high school, I decided to change my second major to Computer Science in the first few weeks. I found
                the way of thinking in Computer Science fascinating, but I found myself learning more through free online
                resources than through the university curriculum. This lead me to change my courses once again, and do a
                mixture of biology and philosophy, which grounded the psychology in hard science, and imbued me with an understanding
                of logic, both in terms of how people
                <i>do</i> think and how people
                <i>should</i> think.
                <br>
                <br> Graduating from university in 2018 meant I had time to learn programming and computer science myself, which
                is what I did. Resuming my programming education at the start of 2018, I have since learned many web technologies
                and applied this knowledge to various projects.

                            Other than basic Java which I learned during University, Python was the first language I was competent using. I found Python
                            to be more beginner--friendly than Java, as concepts such as type checking and scope declarations
                            were not required. This reignited my passion for coding and allowed me to learn the primary principles
                            of coding before focussing on more complex paradigms and techniques.
                            <br>
                            <br> While Python was enjoyable to use, I wanted to be able to make web apps and web sites, which
                            meant I would need to learn JavaScript.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Like many, I initially found JavaScript to be more convoluted and illogical than, say, Python. However, as I gradually came
                            to terms with the philosophy of the language, and became familiar with the inner workings of
                            JavaScript, my confusion and frustration would later turn into appreciation for the nuances of
                            this charismatic language.
                            <br>
                            <br> At this point I would need to learn HTML and CSS to utilise JavaScript, the language of the
                            web.

                            I was familiar with HTML after making websites during university for an elective paper I was enrolled in and re-familiarizing
                            myself with HTML was relatively easy. But until I had mastered HTML I was determined to continue
                            optimizing my use of HTML5 and the available API, aiming to keep HTML as simple as possible and
                            to employ best practices to remedy any bad habits I may have acquired.

                        <p>
                            Like HTML, I was already familiar with CSS. CSS potentially has more room for improvement and thus room for error, compared
                            to HTML. This meant learning how to properly use things like flex-box, grid, pseudo-elements
                            and animations was the next step towards developing my front-end skills.

                            Once comfortable with creating stylistic, but ultimately static web pages, using JS, CSS and HTML, I was interested in pursuing
                            Node.js as the next step in my coding education. Like vanilla JS, I found Node.js very interesting,
                            after understanding the internals like the interaction between JS and C++.

                        <p>
                            Electron provided a way to build a desktop app with the languages, libraries and frameworks I had already learned. I jumped
                            into Electron shortly after Node, as a way to practice using Node, and to make something that
                            was not possible purely within a browser.

                            To bring my front-end skills to an acceptable level I needed to learn a JavaScript view framework. After initially understanding
                            the basics of React, I looked at Vue.js for comparison, and found it suited my needs while also
                            being faster to get up and running than React. I learned Vue alongside the creation of
                            <a href="#juke">juke</a>.
                            <br>
                            <br> While I am familiar with and more inclined to use Vue at the moment, I will be looking into
                            using React in the future.

                            Sass is the latest technology I have invested time into, and was used to make this web page. Sass (SCSS syntax) took a short
                            time to learn, but has been a huge time-saver which I wish I had picked up earlier.
